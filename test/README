The Servlet can be run as "Developers Sandbox" in the context of
sandbox.smartplatforms.org as described by
http://wiki.chip.org/smart-project/index.php/Developers_Documentation:_Getting_Started

1) Deploy SMArt_client_test_servlet.war in your favorite servlet
container.  If testing against http://sandbox-api.smartplatforms.org
with the pre-available consumer key/secret and oauth_callback URL, you
can deploy as is.  Otherwise you might have to edit web.xml within the
.war before deploying.

2) Edit index.html and after_auth.html so the redirects redirect to
where your servlet container runs the servlet.  The last parts of the
redirect URLs, "SMArtClientJavaOAuthTester/after_auth.html" are
unchanging, unless you edit web.xml to change the
"SMArtClientJavaOAuthTester" part.  The earlier parts of the redirect
URLs depend on your servlet container and how that container is
deployed.

3) Copy index.html and after_auth.html to your web server (typically
this is also your serlvet container) in a way that makes them
accessible to the sandbox as "http://localhost:8000/index.html" and
"http://localhost:8000/after_auth.html".  You might have to
re-configure your servlet container to use port 8000.  If you will be
using different URLs for these files, you must coordinate with the
sandbox administrators.
